## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# labeled data
wsb_labeled_simp <- read_rds(here("etc/wsb_labeled_simplified.rds"))

# distribution of labeled radius
wsb_labeled_simp %>% 
  ggplot(aes(radius/1000)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~state, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(x = "radius (km)")

# Compare labeled wsb and TIGER place radius: do they align for states, 
# and hence is it a valid assumption to train on TIGER place radii? 
# Could do a simple t-tst difference in median between groups

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
