# Introduction

Herein, we present a preliminary approach to create a nationwide water service spatial boundary layer for community water systems. Importantly, this report builds on a previous report `eda_february.html` that should be read first for background, context, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) that informs the approach taken in the work described in this report. 

The national water service boundary layer (henceforth, **wsb**) is created in three tiers, arranged by data and model fiedlity.
