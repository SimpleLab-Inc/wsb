# plot connection count against polygon area and convex hull area

# output plots of all polygons and convex hulls to visually inspect

# calculate percent increase in area from polygon to convex hull to
# estimate distribution of uncertainty in area imposed by this approach

# explore relationships between connection count and water system type
# (i.e., small, med, large)

# explore other predictors with presumed large explanatory power
