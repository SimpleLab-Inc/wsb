# Contributor Guidelines

This document is meant as a primer on contributing to this repository. We strive to uphold a high standard of open-source collaboration through this repository. Please read this document before contributing to the repository. Also read Github's [code of conduct](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/a980e8037dfca61dea25796f542ea5c0fad93ee9/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for reference to best practices interacting with others through the repository.

## Types of Contributions

### Issue

Issues enable task-tracking. If you identify something that is incorrect or doesn't run, you can create an issue that is clearly labeled. If want to work on a contribution or refactor via a pull request, you should first create an issue that outlines the problem you are working on and obtain a green-light by the project maintainer(s).

### Pull Request

Pull requests allow users to suggest a change to the repository. Pull requests will only be reviewed and incorporated if they were first agreed upon in an Issue by the project maintainer(s). Furthermore, all PRs should link to an issue(s) closed by the PR for clarity.

## How to Contribute

### Issue

#### Creating an Issue

Create a **new issue** if you find a problem you want to fix, identify an error in the code, or propose a refactor. Be sure to review existing issues first before posting, to ensure you do not double post. Follow the following steps to post an issue:

-   Clearly label new issue; e.g. if you have an issue about the transformer for AZ, label the issue accordingly: `transformer/az {descriptive message}`.
-   Use "labels" (e.g., "transformer", "downloader", "analysis", "bugfix", etc.) to clearly mark what part of the pipeline your issue addresses.
-   Include a clear description of the issue.

For issues concerning larger refactors or feature developments, indicate that the issue needs review as a proposal and be sure to include your proposed plan.

Issues should not be used to make feature requests.

#### Solving an Issue

If you review existing issues and find one you would like to solve, assign yourself the issue and propose the solution through a pull request linked to that issue.

### Pull Requests

If you are solving an existing issue or working on an issue you created, always code on a branch from `develop`. When you stage and commit your code to the branch, you can create a pull request. You may also create a pull request from a forked repository.
